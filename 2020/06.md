## Events

### Dev Around The Sun

The .NET Foundation presented [Dev Around The Sun](https://devaroundthesun.org) on May 12th and 13th, the first of its kind, a 24-hour telethon style developer conference which was live on Twitch, YouTube and Mixer to raise funds for [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/coronavirus-outbreak/), helping those affected most by COVID-19.  

Dev Around the Sun was a cross-platform, language-agnostic event with high-level tech talks to human skills sessions and everything in between.  Our renowned speakers from a broad set of communities came together from around the globe to livestream for 24-hours of informative and fun content from the comfort of their homes.  We reached over **71k unique viewers** and raised over **$53K** in relief funds.  We will be hosting all the speakers sessions on our [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-Vejli7U-3GldOH_b8I6A)

One of the new features that shipped in 0.38.0 was support for ANSI escape codes. Turns out, this feature breaks the service message logging in some CI systems. The problem was identified when Cake was running in TeamCity, but it is possible that other systems are affected.

## Meetups

### Looking for speakers to go deep on AWS?

Would your user group \ meetup appreciate hearing about .NET on AWS from an AWS .NET developer advocate? The team of longtime .NET developers would be thrilled to join your virtual user group to chat about the latest for .NET in the cloud. 

Here’s a list of example topics:
- **Overview of .NET on AWS:** AWS has over a decade supporting .NET on the cloud. We’ll provide an overview of all the support you might not know existed, such as free tools for Visual Studio, PowerShell, Azure DevOps, etc.
- **Building serverless with .NET:** The future is now for serverless, and AWS is ensuring .NET is vibrant in that future. We’ll show you how anybody can get started and take advantage of the speed and ease of using serverless with .NET.
- **Infrastructure as .NET:** Why learn JSON or YAML to build on the cloud if you can just use .NET? Learn how to model and provision cloud resources in .NET with the open source AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
- **PowerShell on AWS:** AWS supports PowerShell and makes it easy to manage your AWS resources in a PowerShell scripting environment. We’ll show you all the things you can easily do on AWS with PowerShell, including native support for serverless. 
- **Something else?** What are you interested in hear about? Blazor? ML? Reach out and let us know.

You can contact the .NET developer advocacy team at **[aws-dotnetfdn-interest-open@amazon.com](mailto://aws-dotnetfdn-interest-open@amazon.com)**. Cheers!
