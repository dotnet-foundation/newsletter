+ **Polly.Contrib.MutableBulkheadPolicy** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.MutableBulkheadPolicy); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.MutableBulkheadPolicy)): provides a version of the classic Polly [Bulkhead](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Bulkhead) (parallel throttle) policy, for which the permitted parallelism can be adjusted while the policy is in use.

+ **[trydotnet-polly](https://github.com/bryanjhogan/trydotnet-polly)**: Interactive samples for Polly policies, enabled via [try-dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/try-dotnet).
